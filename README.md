# Sports with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

this project involve applying artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms to various aspects of sports, such as performance analysis, player tracking, game strategy optimization, injury prevention, or even fan engagement.It could explore how AI can enhance and revolutionize the world of sports, providing valuable insights, real-time analytics, and predictive models to athletes, coaches, and sports enthusiasts. 


## Background

This project solve problems like:
* Performance Analysis
* Player Tracking
* Injury Prevention

## How is it used?

This is how you create code examples:
```
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load video or camera feed
video = cv2.VideoCapture('path_to_video.mp4')

# Initialize background subtractor
bg_subtractor = cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()

while True:
    ret, frame = video.read()

    if not ret:
        break

    # Preprocessing: Apply background subtraction
    fg_mask = bg_subtractor.apply(frame)

    # Apply thresholding to obtain binary image
    _, binary_image = cv2.threshold(fg_mask, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

    # Apply morphological operations (e.g., erosion, dilation) to enhance image
    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)
    binary_image = cv2.erode(binary_image, kernel, iterations=1)
    binary_image = cv2.dilate(binary_image, kernel, iterations=2)

    # Find contours in the binary image
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(binary_image, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    # Filter contours based on area or other criteria
    filtered_contours = [cnt for cnt in contours if cv2.contourArea(cnt) > 100]

    # Draw bounding boxes around the filtered contours
    for contour in filtered_contours:
        (x, y, w, h) = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    # Display the frame with bounding boxes
    cv2.imshow('Player Tracking', frame)

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release video and close windows
video.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
